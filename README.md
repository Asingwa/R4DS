Learning from the book R for Data Science by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.
This project and the scripts therein are produced while learning R using the book R for Data Science. The objective of the book is to 
teach how to:
    * Get data into R 
    * Get it into the most useful structure
    * Transform data
    * Visualize data
    * Model data

The book is divided into 5 main sections -Explore, Wrangle, Program,Model and Communicate - with several chapters in each. I have therefore organized the scripts according to their Section.
